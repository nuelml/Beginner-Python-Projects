# Beginner-Python-Projects
This is a collection of the 33 beginner Python projects I am working on.

# About
These projects are designed to help new Python programmers get started with the language.
Right now, the projects are still a work in progress, but I'm aiming to have them all completed by December 2025.
The projects cover a range of topics on python basics.

I created this repository to help others learn Python and to showcase my own learning journey. If you have any feedback or would like to contribute, please don't hesitate to reach out
